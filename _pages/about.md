Hi

I'm Wan Chao, currently working at HiSilicon Technologies Co., Ltd. in Shanghai. I earned both my bachelor's and master's degrees from Nanjing University of Science and Technology. 

My research interests lie in smart cities, with a focus on urban micro-simulation, reinforcement learning, signal control, and spatiotemporal prediction.

Previously, my research areas mainly included:

- Urban micro-traffic simulation, and the need for reinforcement learning for urban traffic simulation platforms.

- Traffic signal control models based on reinforcement learning, with particular focus on the model's generalization ability, handling out-of-distribution (OOD) situations, and adaptive traffic signal control models applicable to the real world.

- A real-world traffic flow prediction model that incorporates the model's understanding of prior knowledge about traffic flow.
