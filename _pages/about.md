Hi,

I'm Wan Chao（万超）, currently working at HiSilicon Technologies Co., Ltd. in Shanghai. I received both my bachelor's and master's degrees from Nanjing University of Science and Technology.

My research interests focus on smart cities, particularly urban micro-simulation, reinforcement learning, traffic signal control, and spatiotemporal prediction.

My previous research mainly covered:

- Urban micro-traffic simulation, with an emphasis on integrating reinforcement learning into large-scale urban traffic simulation platforms.

- Reinforcement learning–based traffic signal control, focusing on model generalization, robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, and adaptive control strategies suitable for real-world deployment.

- Real-world traffic flow prediction models that explicitly incorporate prior knowledge and domain understanding of traffic dynamics.

My long-term goal is to develop intelligent urban systems that are practical, scalable, and applicable in real-world settings.

Skills: Traffic Simulation, Traffic Forecasting, Traffic Signal Control, Reinforcement Learning, Python, C/C++, Java, CUDA
